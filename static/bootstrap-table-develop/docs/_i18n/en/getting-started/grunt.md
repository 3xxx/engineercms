# Compiling CSS and JavaScript []({{ site.repo }}/blob/develop/docs/_i18n/{{ site.lang }}/getting-started/grunt.md)

---

Bootstrap table uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for its build system, with convenient methods for working with the framework. It's how we compile our code, run tests, and more.

## Installing Grunt

To install Grunt, you must **first** [download and install node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) (which includes npm). npm stands for [node packaged modules](http://npmjs.org/) and is a way to manage development dependencies through node.js.

Then, from the command line:

1. Navigate to the root `/bootstrap-table/` directory, then run `npm install`. npm will look at the `package.json` file and automatically install the necessary local dependencies listed there.

When completed, you'll be able to run the various Grunt commands provided from the command line.

## Available Grunt commands

### `npm run grunt docs` (Build & test the docs assets)

Builds and tests CSS, JavaScript, and other assets which are used when running the documentation locally via `jekyll serve`.

### `npm run grunt` (Build absolutely everything and run tests)

Compiles and minifies CSS and JavaScript, builds the documentation website, runs the HTML5 validator against the docs, regenerates the Customizer assets, and more. Requires [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

## Troubleshooting

Should you encounter problems with installing dependencies or running Grunt commands, first delete the `/node_modules/` directory generated by npm. Then, rerun `npm install`.
