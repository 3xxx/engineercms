## Contributing

Contributions to the `jsoneditor` library are very welcome! We can't do this
alone. You can contribute in different ways: spread the word, report bugs, come
up with ideas and suggestions, and contribute to the code.

There are a few preferences regarding code contributions:

- `jsoneditor` follows the node.js code style as described
  [here](http://nodeguide.com/style.html).
- Send pull requests to the `develop` branch, not the `master` branch.
- Only commit changes done in the source files under `./src`, not to the builds
  which are located under the `./dist` folder.

Thanks!
