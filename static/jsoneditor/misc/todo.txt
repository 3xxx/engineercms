JSON EDITOR TODO

________________________________________________________________________

VERSION 1: Basic functionality

Bug: on Opera, you cannot double click to select a word in the field/value
     editable div

Bug: get the breaking of long words working on Firefox an IE. Does not work for
     a word like "blablablablablablablablablablablablablablablablablablablabla",
     and in IE also not for urls.

for highlighting and expanding: send a timestamp, and when very large,
    split via a timeout in different parts so, the browser stays responsive.

________________________________________________________________________

VERSION 2: Functionality

store the contents in the browser. also store all revisions (used with undo/redo)

add documentation/information about JSON in general

write documentation about the sourcecode

warning when an object has multiple fields with the same name

create options:
  - collapsed: true/false
  - editableFields: true/false

________________________________________________________________________

VERSION 3: Performance

performance improvements: lazy loading of the HTML elements
method getValue() should retrieve the data from its in memory JSON, and not 
  by reading the from the fields on screen. Fields on screen must directly
  update their value in memory when changed. 
  Also, the in memory JSON should correspond one to one to the real JSON data...

automatically update left or right panel contents on change?


________________________________________________________________________

VERSION 4: Validator

Implement a JSON Schema validator
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json#Schema
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-03

the editor on the right will get an extra button on the right: for specifying 
validation  parameters. On the left, we will get two text editors on top of each
other: one with the JSON data, the other with the JSON schema.
By default, the validator is not visible. There will be an option in the main
menu to toggle validator.

Also: create buttons to generate JSON from a schema.
