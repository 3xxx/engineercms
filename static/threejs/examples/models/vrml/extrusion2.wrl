# Computational cost of Extrusion compared to IndexedFaceSet: quicker to download, takes time to calculate polygonal faces and normals during initial loading, equally fast at run time.
# Authoring capabilities of Extrusion compared to IndexedFaceSet: can be more complicated to express, but also can provide great detail with much less effort.
